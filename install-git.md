You can download and install Git from this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads

After the installation check whether the installation was successful. You can do this by

1. checking the git version by typing git -v in a terminal / console / git bash


If your terminal / console / git bash responds with a reasonable version number you can close this issue. 

If you face any issues during this step, please reach out to a friend or to your lecturer of choice :)
